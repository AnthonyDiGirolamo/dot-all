;;; Commentary:

;; This package is a complete wrapper around all imagemagick commands
;; with descriptions, autocompletion (for some commands) and hints
;; displayed in prompt using eimp.el to execute its commands and
;; resize images.
;;
;; Switch the blimp minor mode on programmatically with:
;;
;;     (blimp-mode 1)
;;
;; or toggle interactively with M-x blimp-mode RET.
;;
;; Switch the minor mode on for all image-mode buffers with:
;;
;;     (add-hook 'image-mode-hook 'blimp-mode)
;;
;; Then once blimp-mode is enabled, do `M-x blimp-interface'
;; to to add commands to be executed on the image.
;;
;; The added commands can be executed with `M-x blimp-execute-command-stack'
;; and cleared with `M-x blimp-clear-command-stack'.
;;
;; If you want to execute the command right after selecting it
;; you can do `M-x blimp-interface-execute'.
;;
;; The prefix of the command can also be changed
;; with `M-x blimp-toggle-prefix'.
