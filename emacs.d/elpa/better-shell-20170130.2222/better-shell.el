;;; Commentary:
;; 
;; This package provides two commands.
;; 
;; better-shell-shell -- cycle through current shells, creating one if
;; no shell exists.  With prefix arg, pop to or create a shell in
;; the same directory (and same host) as the current buffer.
;; 
;; better-shell-remote-open -- open a shell on a remote server
